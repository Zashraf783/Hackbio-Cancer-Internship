# The central dogma of molecular biology: A simple introduction to its concept and machine learning/data science applications #

The central dogma of microbiology was first declared by Crick in 1958\. Its concept was that the genetic code of life, which was figured out 5 years prior to the conceptualisation of the central dogma when the structure of DNA was figured out, would flow from the DNA form inside the nucleus and get translated into the RNA form found all over the cell. Then, it gets translated into its protein form, which, with further enhancements and folding, carries out the function of the gene from which it was translated. The central dogma also helped us by providing a more profound and direct relation to what causes cancers and how to cure them. 

Before its discovery, it was thought that the cause of cancer was trauma, miasma (bad air), and or parasitic infections; some of these causes may hold a piece of the truth, but what really helped us further understand and paved the road towards curing cancer is the declaration of the central dogma and understanding of genetics and hereditary factors. Today, central dogma has become the center of many cancer diagnoses and treatments, and a variety of methods carry out these diagnoses, but we are going to focus on machine learning and data science.  

## Machine learning applications on the central dogma ## 

Machine learning is used in bioinformatics by applying algorithms and statistical models that analyse and interpret biological data from genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, which are high-throughput, leading to it being hard to analyse by traditional methods. It can be used for gene expression prediction, cancer diagnosis, RNA splicing predictions, and cancer treatment response; this can be achieved by training the models through supervised learning on large genomics and expression profile datasets. All of this was made possible by understanding the relationship between DNA, RNA, and proteins, which was provided to us by the central dogma.

## Data science applications on central dogma ##

On the other hand, Data science is used in bioinformatics as the tools and framework needed to handle the complex data generated by the many omics and extract meaningful insights from it. It can be used to visualise and analyse RNA and DNA sequences and Integrate the Multi-Omics data, providing a better view of the molecular level of cancer and helping identify important regulatory pathways found in tumorigenesis.

## Conclusion ##

The central dogma of molecular biology has dramatically impacted how we view genetics and cancer by clarifying the relationship between DNA, RNA, and protein in a way that helped pave the way towards many of todayâ€™s greatest theories and discoveries in molecular biology. Machine learning and data science have emerged as promising tools to analyse and interpret its increasing complexity. By applying them to cancer research, we may develop more effective and personalised therapies and diagnostics leading to a future with little to no cancer.
